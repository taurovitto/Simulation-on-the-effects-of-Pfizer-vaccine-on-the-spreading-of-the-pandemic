Abstract: This research project has the objective of analyzing the possible outcomes of a vaccine on a virus spread among the world, i.e. a pandemic. In particular, we will focus our efforts in optimizing two main factors: the percentage of people to vaccinate and the age group to vaccinate first. Our strategy is to find out what is the lowest possible fraction of the population to vaccinate in order to promptly lessen the virulence of the pandemic and whether vaccinating the elderly first will result in a more positive outcome in the fight against the virus. The results will show that a percentage of 60% will be sufficient to rapidly thwart the pandemic, and that vaccinating the elderly first will hinder the spread of the virus.
